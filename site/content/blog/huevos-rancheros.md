* 1 cup rice, cooked
* 3 tbsp salsa
* 3 tbsp water
* 4 eggs
* 4 soft flour tortillas
* 14 oz refried beans

Cook rice according to the package instructions. 

In a high-sided saut√© pan, combine salsa and water. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Crack eggs into the salsa, being careful not to break the yolks. Poach until eggs have reached desired doneness, using a spoon to gently cover the eggs with the poaching liquid. 

Meanwhile, heat a can of refried beans in a small saucepan. Warm tortillas in a cast iron pan over medium-low heat on the stove top or in the microwave, roughly 35 seconds. 

Serve rice, eggs, beans, and tortillas together and covered with the salsa. Garnish with chopped cilantro, avocado, and sour cream or queso fresco
