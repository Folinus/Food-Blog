Pork loin 

* 1 1/2 tsp ground thyme 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
* 5 bay leaves 
* 3 potatoes, peeled and cubed 
* 2 carrots, peeled and cut into large pieces 
* 1 onion, chopped 
* 2 apples, cored, peeled, and cubed 
* 5 garlic cloves, crushed 
* 4 sprigs rosemary

Preheat oven to 350°. 

In a roasting pan, rub pork loin with thyme, salt, and pepper. Lay 5 bay leaves on top of the roast. Scatter potato, carrot, onion, apple, and garlic around the roast. At each end of the pan, place 2 sprigs of rosemary. Drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil. Roast for 1 hour, or until pork is cooked through—no longer pink but still juicy.
