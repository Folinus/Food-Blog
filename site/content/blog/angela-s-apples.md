* 12 oz cranberries 
* Zest from 4 oranges 
* Juice of 6 freshly squeezed oranges, strained 
* 1 1/2 cups dark brown sugar 
* 12 Rome apples, halved and cored 
* 12 cinnamon sticks, halved

Preheat oven to 325Â°. 

In a sauce pot, boil zest with 1 quart of water for 10 minutes. In the meantime, combine the cranberries, brown sugar, and orange juice in a large bowl. Drain the water and pour hot zest over the cranberry mixture. Toss to combine completely. 

Arrange apples in a baking dish. Fill with cranberry mixture, then pour the remaining liquid over the apples. Top each apple half with a cinnamon stick and bake for 35 minutes.
