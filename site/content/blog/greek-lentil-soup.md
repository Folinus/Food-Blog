* 3 garlic cloves, minced 
* 28 oz can of whole tomatoes 
* 1 bay leaf â€¢ 4 sprigs parsley

Soak lentils in 3 quarts of water overnight. Alternatively, bring to a boil and cool. Regardless of the preparation method, reserve water for the soup. 

In a large stock pot, combine onion, celery, carrots, garlic, tomatoes with juice, bay, parsley, basil, and oregano with the lentils and their soaking liquid. Add 1 teaspoon of salt and 10 grinds of the pepper mill. Bring to a simmer over low heat for 2 hours or until the lentils are tender.
