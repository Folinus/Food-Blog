+++
* 1 tsp Dijon mustard 
* 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 
* 1 tbsp lemon juice 
* 1 garlic clove, crushed 
* 1/2 cup olive oil 
* 1 lb (or more) beets

Combine mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil in a small bowl or measuring cup. Let sit at least 30 minutes at room temperature so the flavors will marry. 

Prepare beets as usual; boil until tender, then cool and peel. Slice beets as narrowly and thinly as possible. Toss in vinaigrette and serve.
