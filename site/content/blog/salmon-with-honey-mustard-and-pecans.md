+++
* 1/2 cup pecan pieces 
* 1 1/2 lb salmon fillet of relatively even thickness 
* 1 tbsp honey 
* 1 tbsp Dijon mustard

Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a dry frying pan, toast pecans until fragrant and warm. Grease a small sheet pan, then lay salmon skin-side down. Combine honey and Dijon in a small bowl or measuring cup, then pour over the fish. Cover with toasted pecans. Bake for 30 minutes or until the fish reaches desired doneness.
