* 4 chicken thighs, cut in half the long way 
* 2 tbsp olive oil 
* 2 garlic cloves, minced 
* 2 green bell peppers, diced 
* 1 onion, diced 
* 2 tomatoes, diced 
* 2 pimentos, chopped 
* 1 tbsp chicken-flavored Better than Bouillon 
* 3 tsp paprika 
* 1/2 tsp saffron 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
* 2 cups rice 
* 3 1/2 cups water 
* 1/2 cup white wine (can substitute for 4 cups of water)

Preheat oven to 325°. 

Heat olive oil in a large, oven-safe frying or paella pan over medium heat. Add chicken, browning all sides deeply. Remove and rest on a plate. 

Lower heat, then add onion and pepper, cooking until softened, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add Bouillon, pimento, tomato, paprika, and saffron. Cook until tomatoes have softened, stirring occasionally. Taste and season with salt and pepper. 

Add rice, stirring to coat. Add water and white wine, simmering until no longer soupy. Finally, bury the browned chicken thighs in the rice. Bake at 325° for 30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through. Remove from the oven and rest for five minutes before serving.
