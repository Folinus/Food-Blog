title = "Cranberry-Almond Broccoli Salad"

+++
* 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion 
* 4 cups coarsely chopped broccoli florets 
* 1/3 cup mayonnaise 
* 1 tbsp cider vinegar 
* 1/4 tsp salt 
* 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper 
* 1/3 cup toasted slivered almonds 
* 1/3 cup dried cranberries

Soak red onion in cold water for 5 minutes. Steam florets for roughly the same period until just tender but firm. 

Combine mayonnaise, cider vinegar, salt, and pepper, stirring well with a whisk. Add red onion, broccoli, almonds, and cranberries, then toss. Cover and chill for 1 hour before serving. 

Note: The salad improves resting overnight, so donâ€™t hesitate to prepare in advance.
