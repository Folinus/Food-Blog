+++
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 large onion, finely sliced 
* 4 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 large potato, thinly sliced
* 1 tsp paprika
* 14 oz can chopped tomatoes, drained
* 1 tsp thyme leaves, plus leaves to garnish
* 3 3/4 cups vegetable broth
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Heat the oil in a large, heavy pan. Add the onion, garlic, potato, and paprika and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the onions have softened but not browned. 

Add the chopped tomatoes, thyme leaves and vegetable stock to the pan. Simmer for 20 minutes or until the potatoes have cooked through. 

Using an immersion or traditional blender, purée three-quarters of the soup, being sure to purée all the garlic. Using a wooden spoon, break up the potatoes slightly, then season to taste. Garnish with chopped thyme and serve.
