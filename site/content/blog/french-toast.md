* 4 slices of bread
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp granulated sugar
* 1 1/2 tbsp milk
* 2 tbsp butter or vegetable oil

In a shallow bowl, beat eggs with cinnamon and sugar. Add a dollop of milk, whisking to combine. Lay bread in the egg mixture, making sure to soak both sides thoroughly. 

In a frying pan, heat butter or oil over low heat. Fry French toasts, gently turning and cooking until nicely browned. Serve with additional cinnamon-sugar, syrup, butter, or jam.
