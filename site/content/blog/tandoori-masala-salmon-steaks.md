+++
* 1 2" salmon steak for every 2 diners 
* India Tree Tandoori Masala seasoning 
* Salt

At least one hour before grilling, sprinkle salmon steaks generously with Tandoori Masala seasoning and salt. (Ed. note: yogurt is traditionally combined with a spice blend like this one to produce a rich marinade.) 

Heat grill. This recipe is a great opportunity to use a fish basket, but if you don't have one, simply be careful when turning the fish. 

Lay salmon steak on the grill and cook undisturbed for 6 minutes with the cover closed. Flip and cook until the salmon reaches desired doneness, checking that a fork slides easily through the entire steak but being careful not to burn.
