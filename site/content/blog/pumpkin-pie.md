* 1 prepared pie shell or sweet crust pastry 
* 1/2 cup sugar 
* 2 eggs 
* 16 oz can pumpkin purée 
* 1 tsp cinnamon 
* 1/2 tsp ginger 
* 1/2 tsp salt

Preheat oven to 425°. Place one prepared pie shell into an 8" pie plate and set aside. 

Combine sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves in a small bowl. In a large bowl, beat eggs lightly. Stir in pumpkin and cinnamon-sugar mixture. Gradually stir in evaporated milk. Carefully pour into the pie shell. Bake for 15 minutes at 425°, then reduce temperature to 350° and bake for 40–50 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 2 hours before serving.
