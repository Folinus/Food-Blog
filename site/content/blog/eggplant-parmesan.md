+++
* 2 eggplants, sliced into rounds 
* Olive oil 
* 28 oz can whole tomatoes, coarsely chopped 
* 8 oz whole milk mozzarella, sliced 
* 1 tbsp garlic salt 
* 2 tsp basil 
* 2 tsp oregano 
* 3 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese 
* Freshly ground black pepper

Arrange sliced eggplants in a colander or on a paper towel and sprinkle with salt, allowing the rounds to weep for 20 minutes. Dry, then fry the eggplant slices in a quarter-inch of olive oil. 

Preheat oven to 400Â°. 

In an 8" baking dish, create a layer of eggplant. Across the layer of eggplant, spread tomatoes, mozzarella, oregano, basil, and garlic salt. Continue layering eggplant and tomato-cheese-herb mixture. Top final tomato-cheese-herb layer with a shower of Parmesan cheese and black pepper. Bake for 35 minutes. After 20 minutes, press out any extra liquid. When the top is bubbly and brown, remove the dish and rest for 10 minutes before serving.
