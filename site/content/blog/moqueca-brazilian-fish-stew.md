+++
* 4 fillets of firm white fish (i.e. tilapia, cod, or haddock) 
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 4 tbsp lime or lemon juice
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 onion, minced
* 1 red, orange, or yellow bell pepper, diced
* 2 cups of chopped tomatoes
* 1 tbsp paprika
* Pinch red pepper flakes
* 4 tbsp chopped cilantro, divided 
* 14 oz can coconut milk 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper

In a bowl, combine garlic, lime or lemon juice, and salt and pepper. Add fish and marinate for 30 minutes. 

Heat olive oil in a dutch over or heavy-bottomed pan. Add onion and pepper, then cook until soft. Add tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Season with paprika, red pepper flakes, and half the chopped cilantro. Stir in coconut milk and taste, adding salt and pepper as needed. 

Nestle the fish fillets into the stew and cover with the excess marinade. Cook the stew on the stove top, spooning the flavorful liquid over the fish for about 3 to 5 minutes or, for thicker cuts, place in a 350Â° oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Garnish with the rest of the chopped cilantro and serve with lime or lemon wedges.
