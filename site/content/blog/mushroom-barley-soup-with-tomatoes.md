Heat olive oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Sauté onions, carrots, and celery until softened. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add mushrooms and barley, sautéing until the mushrooms let down their water. Add the tomato, chicken broth, and bay before tasting for seasoning. Cook 50 minutes, or until barley is done.
