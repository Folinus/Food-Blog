title = "Roasted Chicken with Greek Rice"

+++
* Small whole chicken, about 5 lbs 
* 1 cup long-grain white rice 
* 1 stalk celery, chopped 
* 1/2 onion, diced 
* 1 cup whole tomato, chopped 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
* 2 cups water

Preheat oven to 350Â°. Rinse whole chicken, sprinkling liberally with salt to scrub surface inside and out. 

Rinse thoroughly and dry. Place chicken in a large, oven-proof baking pan. Spread rice, onion, celery and tomato evenly around chicken in pan. Add water and season with salt and pepper. 

Bake for 1 hour or until leg is easily turned out of its socket and rice is fluffy and cooked. While cooking, tilt the pan every 15 to 20 minutes to distribute the rendered liquid and fat onto the rice.
