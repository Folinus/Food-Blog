+++
* 1 or 2 prepared pie shells or sweet crust pastry 
* 1 quart raspberries 
* 3 tbsp flour 
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar

Preheat oven to 350Â°. Place prepared pastry into an 8" pie plate. Pour in raspberries. Sprinkle with flour and sugar, then stir gently to combine. Leave pie open or cover with a lattice top. Bake for 50 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. (Ed. note: Combining the raspberries with flour and sugar in a bowl to mix will produce a better-incorporated raspberry filling without lumps.)
