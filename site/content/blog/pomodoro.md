* 1 tbsp olive oil 
* 4 garlic cloves, sliced thinly
* 2 dried de Arbol chili peppers, optional 
* 28 oz can tomato puree 
* 1 tbsp tomato paste 
* 4–6 basil leaves plus more for garnish, optional 
* 1 lb bucatini, spaghetti, or pasta of your choosing

Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Sauté garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add dried chili peppers, tomato purée, paste, and basil, stirring to combine. Lower heat and cover with a well-fitting lid, cooking until oil begins to separate from sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

Bring water to boil in a large stock pot. Salt and cook pasta according to package instructions before draining. Combine with sauce and serve.
