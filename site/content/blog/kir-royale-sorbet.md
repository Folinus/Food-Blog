* 2/3 cup granulated sugar 
* 2/3 cup water  
* 2 1/2 cups raspberries 
* 1 cup Champagne or sparkling wine 
* 1/4 cup crème de cassis

In a small saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat. 

In a blender or food processor, combine raspberries with sparkling wine, crème de cassis, and sugar syrup until smooth. Strain purée through a fine sieve, pressing hard on the solids. Add lemon juice. Chill until mixture is cool, then freeze in an ice cream machine.
