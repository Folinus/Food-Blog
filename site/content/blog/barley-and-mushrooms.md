* 1/2 cup barley 
* 1 1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth 
* 1 onion, diced 
* 2 garlic cloves, minced 
* 1 cup sliced mushrooms 
* 1 tbsp fresh dill 
* Olive oil 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper

In a small, tightly covered saucepan, cook barley with broth on low until barley is split but not soft. If water is not fully absorbed, strain and set aside. 

In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Saut√© onions until caramelized. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add mushrooms and cook until mushrooms let down their water, 20-30 minutes. Add cooked barley and combine. Taste for seasoning and garnish with dill before serving.
