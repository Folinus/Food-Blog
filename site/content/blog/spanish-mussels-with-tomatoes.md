+++
* 1 lb mussels 
* 1 onion, diced 
* 2 garlic cloves, diced 
* 2 dried chilies, seeds removed 
* 2 tbsp olive oil 
* 14 oz can whole tomatoes 
* 1 tbsp tomato paste 
* 1/2 cup beef broth 
* 1 tsp paprika 
* Freshly ground black pepper

To prepare mussels, rinse and remove any seaweed. Any mussels that remain open are dead and should be discarded. 

Heat olive oil in a wok with a lid or other large, covered pan. Saut√© onion, garlic, and chillies. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, paprika, pepper, and broth, stirring to incorporate. Cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes, or until the tomatoes have softened. Add mussels, cover, and cook until mussels open, about 10 minutes. 

Serve mussels with broth in soup bowls along with a crusty roll or baguette for dipping.
