* 1/4 cup coconut oil 
* 1 cup chopped onion 
* 1 garlic clove, minced 
* 1 1/2 cup vegetable broth 
* 1 tsp curry powder 
* 1/2 tsp salt

Heat 2 tbsp of coconut oil in a deep pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the onions and garlic, cooking until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in the vegetable broth, curry powder, salt, coriander, and red pepper flakes. Cover, and boil 15–20 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Whisk in pumpkin and coconut milk, and cook for another 5 minutes. Blend using an immersion blender. Serve with honey for diners looking for some additional sweetness.
