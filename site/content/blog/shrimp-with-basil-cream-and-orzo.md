+++
* 2 tbsp olive oil  
* 2 garlic cloves, chopped  
* 1/2 yellow onion, sliced  
* 2 fresh or 5 whole peeled tomatoes  
* 1 cup orzo  
* 1 cup half-and-half 
* 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth  
* 1/4 cup basil, coarsely chopped  
* 12 large shrimp, peeled

Heat olive oil in a wide-bottomed pan. Sauté onion until soft. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and sauté until softened, about 10 minutes. Add orzo, half-and-half, broth, and basil, cooking for 10 minutes on a low simmer. Stir in peeled shrimp and cook for 2 additional minutes. Remove from heat and let rest for 5 minutes before serving, during which time the shrimp will continue cooking.
