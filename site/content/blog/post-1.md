Soft-scrambled or hard, sunny-side up, over easy, or poached. Omelettes, tortillas, quiches, huevos rancheros, and shakshuka—all of these are magical ways to serve an egg. The most important thing to remember about eggs: they like slow cooking over low heat in a non stick pan. If you can wait for them to set or cook before disturbing them, your breakfasts will be delicious!

#### Sunny-Side Up 

Crack an egg in a non-stick pan and leave to slowly cook until yolk reaches desired doneness.

#### Over-Easy

Crack an egg in a non-stick pan and leave to cook until the bottom of the egg is completely white. Flip and cook briefly. Yolk should be soft, with a fully cooked white.

#### Over-Hard

Crack an egg in a non-stick pan and leave to cook until the bottom of the egg is completely white. Flip and cook yolk to desired doneness.

#### Scrambled 

Crack 4 eggs in bowl. Add 3 tbsp of water or milk and beat until light yellow, trying to loft air into the mixture. Heat 2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil in a non-stick pan over medium-low heat until the oil thins or ripples. Add eggs and cook, folding and scrambling to distribute uncooked egg onto bottom of pan and create curds. Remove when eggs meet desired doneness, but remember that they'll continue to cook just a bit even after you've removed them from the heat. 

#### Poached

Bring 1” of water to boil in a small sauce pot with a small amount of white vinegar. Lower to a simmer and create a vortex using a silicone spatula. Crack egg(s) into the pan of water, releasing the contents close to the surface of the water so that the egg(s) holds its shape. Cook until egg white is translucent. The yolk should be runny, with a fully set but soft white.
