Fry bacon until crispy, reserving 1 tablespoon of rendered fat in a small bowl or measuring cup. 

In serving bowl, whisk eggs until completely combined. Add cheese and stir. Add drained pasta and bacon to bowl of eggs and cheese. Toss, adding rendered fat and cooking water slowly to emulsify the sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste, and garnish with additional Parmesan cheese to serve.
