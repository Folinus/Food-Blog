+++
* 1 to 2 lbs of whole fish, gutted and scaled 
* 2 tbsp sherry or Chinese sweet wine 
* 2 tbsp soy sauce 
* 2 tbsp grated ginger 
* 4 garlic cloves, minced 
* 1 tbsp chili paste 
* 1 tsp sesame oil 
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil 
* 1 bunch green onions, chopped 
* 1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped

Preheat oven to 350Â°. 

Rinse fish and dry. Season with salt and pepper. Place into an oven-proof baking dish. 

Combine sherry, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, chili paste, sesame and vegetable oils in a measuring cup. Pour over fish and allow to marinate an hour at room temperature, turning and/or basting occasionally. Bake for 15 minutes or until fish has turned white and is easy to pierce and separate from the bone. Place fish on a serving platter, drizzle with cooking juices, and garnish with green onion and cilantro.
