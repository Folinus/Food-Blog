* 1/2 lb frozen-at-sea shrimp 
* 3 Kirby cucumbers, diced 
* 1 onion, diced 
* 1 bell pepper, diced 
* 2 tomatoes, diced 
* 6 tbsp olive oil 
* 3 tbsp red wine vinegar 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Defrost the shrimp and shell. Boil in their own liquid until just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Set aside and cool. 

While the shrimp is cooling, combine cucumbers, onion, bell pepper, and tomatoes in a serving dish. In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Dress vegetables. Cut cooled shrimp into thirds, add to vegetables, and toss before serving.
