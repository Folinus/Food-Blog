Cut one garlic or Italian bread loaf lengthwise, then into individual slices. Toast open under a broiler until the bread begins to color. Rub with fresh garlic, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and, if desired, oregano.

Bruschetta can also be served with a finely chopped mix of tomatoes, onions, and pepper piled on top of the toasted, garlicked bread.
