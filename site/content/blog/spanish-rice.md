* 3 1/2 cups chicken broth 
* 1 large onion, diced 
* 2 green bell peppers, diced 
* 2 garlic cloves, minced 
* 2 chopped tomatoes 
* 3 tsp paprika 
* 1/4 tsp saffron 
* 2 cups medium or long-grain rice 
* 1/2 cup white wine 
* Olive oil

Preheat oven to 350°. In a small sauce pot, bring broth to a boil, then lower heat to keep warm. 

Heat olive oil in a wide pan over medium heat. Add and sauté onion, green pepper, and garlic until soft. Add tomato, paprika, and saffron, browning gently. Stir in rice, making sure to coat the grains. Season with 1 tsp salt and 10 twists of the pepper mill. Add broth and wine, then bring to a boil. Cook on medium heat until most of the water is evaporated. Bake for 20 minutes.
