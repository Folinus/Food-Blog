+++
* Bone-in leg of lamb, not larger than 6 lbs 
* 2 tsp salt and 20 twists freshly ground black pepper 
* 2 tsp oregano 
* 2 tsp thyme 
* 15 garlic cloves, finely minced 
* 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil

Preheat the oven to 350°. To prepare the lamb, trim off all the fat. Liberally rub all over with salt, pepper, oregano, and thyme. In a small bowl, combine finely minced garlic with olive oil to create a paste. Spread garlic paste onto the top of the lamb. Bake in the middle of the oven for roughly 15 minutes per pound. Once cooked (a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the leg should register 155°F), transfer to a cutting board and let it stand for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
