* 1 prepared pie shell or short crust pastry
* 1/2 onion, diced
* 1/2 lb sweet Italian sausage, casings removed
* 1 bag fresh spinach
* 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup cream or milk

Preheat oven to 400 . Place prepared pastry into a pie plate and set aside. 

Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed, non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Saut√© onion until just softened, then add sausage and cook until browned. Add spinach and cook until wilted, then remove from heat and cool. 

In a blender, combine eggs and milk and blend for 1 minute. Add cheese, stirring to incorporate.

Pour sausage, spinach and onions into bottom of pie crust. Top with egg and cheese mixture. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until eggs are set to desired doneness. Remove the quiche from the oven and rest for 5 minutes before serving.
