* 1 lb of lentils 
* 3 quarts water 
* 2 tbsp olive oil 
* 1 onion, chopped 
* 2 carrots, chopped into coins 
* 2 stalks of celery, chopped 
* 1 lb sausage, casings removed 
* 1 leek, chopped 
* 1 tsp cumin 
* 1/2 tsp ground clove 
* 2 bay leaves 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Soak lentils in water overnight, then reserve the liquid for cooking. 

Heat olive oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Sauté onion, carrots, and celery until softened. Add sausage and cook through, breaking apart with a wooden spoon. Add leek, cumin, clove, and bay, cooking briefly to bloom spices. Add lentils and soaking liquid, then season to taste. Cook until lentils are soft, 60–90 minutes.
