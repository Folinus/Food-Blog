+++
* 1 small fryer chicken, about 3 lbs 
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1 cup chopped celery, leaves and all
* 5 sprigs parsley, chopped
* 2 sprigs rosemary, chopped or 1 tsp dried
* 2 bay leaves
* 1/2 tsp sage
* 3 carrots, chopped into coins
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Cooked rotini, orzo, rice, or your favorite soup noodle

Clean chicken with cold water. Place in a stock pot and cover with water. Add onion, celery, parsley, rosemary, bay, and sage. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and 6 grinds of the pepper mill. Simmer on low heat for 2 hours, or until the chicken falls off the bone. Depending on how done you like your carrots, add them earlier or later in the cooking process. 

Remove chicken and carefully separate meat from the carcass. Chop into small pieces, avoiding any bones. Add chicken back to the soup. 

In a separate pot, prepare rotini, orzo, rice, or your favorite soup noodle according to their instructions. Drain, then add to individual bowls and top with soup.
