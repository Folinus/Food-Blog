+++
* 1 package of Pillsbury buttermilk biscuits
* 1 lb breakfast sausage, casings removed
* 2 tbsp flour
* 2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil
* 2 cups milk, warmed
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Prepare and bake the biscuits according to the package instructions. 

While the biscuits are baking, fry the sausage in a cast iron skillet, breaking apart with a wooden spoon. Remove from the skillet and set aside. 

Make a roux by adding flour to the fat rendered from the sausage. If the mixture looks dry, add oil. Cook until the mixture resembles a paste and begins to darken. Slowly add in milk, stirring constantly with a whisk so the flour doesnâ€™t clump. Season with salt and pepper, then add the sausage to the pan and stir to combine. 

Ladle sausage gravy onto halved biscuits and serve.
