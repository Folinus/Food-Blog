title = "Ginger Cucumber Salad with Scallops"

+++
* 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 lb thin-skinned cucumbers 
* 1/2 cup rice or white vinegar 
* 1/4 cup water 
* 2" piece ginger, peeled and minced or grated 
* 2 tbsp sugar 
* 1 tsp salt 
* 3 tbsp grapeseed or other neutral oil 
* 1 lb sea scallops 
* 1 onion, sliced 
* 1/2 tsp ground turmeric, optional 
* 2 tbsp sesame seeds

Thinly slice cucumbers, preferably with a mandolin. With thick cucumbers, peel, halve lengthwise, and scoop out seeds before slicing. 

Mix vinegar, ginger, sugar and salt. Toss with cucumbers and let stand for 30â€“60 minutes, or refrigerate if marinating for more than 1 hour in warm weather. 

Just before serving, drain excess liquid. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Sear scallops, about 2 minutes per side, then remove to a plate. Turn heat to medium, add remaining oil, onions and turmeric. Cook until onion softens, about 5 minutes. 

Meanwhile, toast sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat until browned and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir onions into cucumbers, top with scallops, and garnish with sesame seeds to serve. 

Shrimp can be substituted for scallops.
