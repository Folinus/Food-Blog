+++
* 4 to 6 salted anchovy fillets, rinsed, dried, and minced 
* 2 tbsp lemon juice 
* 1 clove garlic, minced 
* 1/3 cup grated Parmesan 
* 1 tsp Dijon mustard 
* 1 tbsp mayonnaise 
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
* 1/2 cup olive oil

In a food processor, combine the anchovies, lemon juice, garlic, cheese, mustard, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste. Slowly drizzle olive oil into the mixture to emulsify the dressing. When the dressing has achieved the consistency of a loose mayonnaise, remove it from the food processor.
